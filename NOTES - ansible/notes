         Security & Compliance 
         Orchestration
         Provisioning

Application deployment: APP ---> Git -----> Ansible ----> Jenkins (optional) ---Servers (i.e. test server or prod server)
                        APP ---> Git -----> jenkins ----> Servers (i.e. test server or prod server)

Configuration management:

Security & Compliance: (Define security wwith playbooks, writes ansible roles to apply DISA STIG, works with existing SSH 
and WinRM protocols, Compatible with different tools for security verification)

Orchestration: orchestrate the order of process and required installations

ANSIBLE IS A PUSH ARCHITECTURE, Puppet and Chef are PULL


Installing Ansible (first option?)
#!/bin/bash (as a script) - check chuck youtube (you need to learn ansible right now!!)
$ yum update -y
$ yum install epel-release -y
$ yum install ansible -y

yum - centOS
apt-get - ubuntu
These should be noted in playbooks also


Installing Ansible: (second option?)
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
  $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install ansible

To see the version of ansible installed
  $ ansible --version

  Host inventory:
    [webservers] server1
    [application] server1 server2
  default path: /etc/ansible/hosts
  on terminal can be access using: sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts


  YAML file starts with ... and ends with ...:
    ...
    james:
      name: james john
      rollNo: 34
      div: B
      sex: male
    ...


    And can be rewritten:
      james: {name: james john, rollNo: 34, div: B, sex: male}


      for list
  countries:
    - America
    - China
    - Canada
    - Iceland

      can be rwritten
  countries: {'America', 'China', 'Canada', 'Iceland'}


In Ansible, the '*' character is used as a wildcard and can have different meanings depending on the context.

In a playbook, if * is used in the hosts: field, it means that the playbook will be executed on all hosts defined in the inventory file. For example, if your inventory file defines the group webservers with several hosts, then hosts: webservers will target only those hosts, whereas hosts: * will target all hosts defined in the inventory file regardless of the group they belong to.

In a task, if * is used in a module's parameter, it means that the module will apply to all items in a list. For example, in a file module, state: directory will create a directory, whereas state: file will create a file. If you want to create both, use state: directory, file

In a task, if * is used in a loop, it means that the task will be executed on all items in the list. For example, in a yum task, name: '*' will update all packages, whereas name: 'httpd' will only update the httpd package.

It's important to note that the wildcard can have different meanings depending on the context, so make sure you understand how it is being used in your playbook.
